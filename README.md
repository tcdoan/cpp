## Week 1 - Highlight few C++ improvements over C
- Replace macro definitions by **const** variables
- Replace macro definitions by **inline** functions
- Use safe **static_cast** instead of unsafe c casts
- Use type safe **iostream** operators
- Use **std::vector** instead of old c arrays
- Use **pass by reference** instead of pointers 
- Use **template <class T>** for generics / code reuse.
