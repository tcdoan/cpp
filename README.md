# cpp 

This repo contains C++ listings for the experiments and assignments from two c++ courses:
- [C++ For C Programmers, Part A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/c-plus-plus-a)
- [C++ For C Programmers, Part B](https://www.coursera.org/learn/c-plus-plus-b)

## week 1 - Highlight few cpp improvements over c.
- Replace macro definitions by **const** variables
- Replace macro definitions by **inline** functions
- Use safe **static_cast** instead of unsafe c casts
- Use type safe **iostream** operators
- Use **std::vector** instead of old c arrays
- Use **pass by reference** instead of pointers 
- Use **template <class T>** for generics / code reuse.
